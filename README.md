# Prediction-for-Airline-Data
The Goal of this project is to get hands-on experience to extract and utilize metadata in the data mining process. The project involves in 5 key milestones that are important in Data Mining process - Data Acquisition and Conversion , Metadata Extraction and Imputation ,Metadata Exploration , Attribute Preparation and Engineering for preparing for Mining Algorithm, Prediction Modelling and Visualization. This project gave me a complete picture of how Data Mining process works and the importance of metadata in data mining process.
